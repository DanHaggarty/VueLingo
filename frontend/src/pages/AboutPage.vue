      <h2>What is VueLingo?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>VueLingo</strong> is a lightweight AI-powered content rewriting tool. It lets you paste any text, choose a tone (like formal, casual, SEO, or even ‚Äúpirate‚Äù), and optionally translate the output into another language ‚Äî all in a clean, fast, and responsive web interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        It‚Äôs designed to help content creators, marketers, and multilingual teams quickly optimize or adapt copy for different tones and audiences.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The frontend is built with <strong>Vue 3</strong>, using script setup, scoped styles, and composables.</li>
        <li>The backend is a <strong>.NET Core API</strong> that calls OpenAI‚Äôs GPT model.</li>
        <li>User input, selected tone, and optional translation language are sent to the backend.</li>
        <li>The backend returns AI-rewritten content, optionally translated.</li>
        <li>Rewrites are stored in <strong>session history</strong> (MVP-style, no login or DB), and can be exported to CSV for review or re-use.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why I built it</h2>
      <p>
        I'm currently applying for a role at <strong>LanguageWire</strong> ‚Äî a company focused on content localization and AI solutions. While I have strong full-stack experience, especially with <strong>.NET Core</strong>, I haven‚Äôt had the chance to use Vue commercially.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I built VueLingo as a way to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prove I can pick up and effectively use <strong>Vue</strong> in a real project.</li>
        <li>Show how I approach building <strong>AI-powered, multilingual</strong> tools.</li>
        <li>Demonstrate thoughtful UX and clean code.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This project was designed, built, and deployed independently ‚Äî from frontend layout to backend integration and Azure deployment.
